            Gone are the days when anyone would dream of describing Perth as a hub for WA’s mining industry. No, the capital has long held its own as an alluring destination for sun-seekers, wine lovers, adventure enthusiasts and foodies who crave experiences that are near impossible to enjoy in most other places, let alone all around the one city. Bar-hopping through the city’s boltholes; beachside camping in Jurien Bay; wine tastings in the Swan Valley; skydiving over the Indian Ocean; getting off-grid on an island paradise; swimming; surfing; arts and cultural events – this is just a snapshot of Perth’s many spoils.

            The port city of Fremantle is worthy of exploring in its own right, but before you check out the Fremantle Markets, street art or cafe scene: head to jail. Spine tingles are guaranteed here as you're escorted through convict chronicles at Fremantle Prison. There are five theatrical tours available and I've done and loved them all. Braver souls should book the spooky Torchlight Tour or the Tunnels Tour.

            Perth is blessed with two idyllic islands, Rottnest Island and Penguin Island. Wadjemup, aka Rottnest Island or ‘Rotto’ to Perthites, glistens in the Indian Ocean. Just 19 kilometres off Fremantle’s coastline, Perth’s island playground feels like it's a million miles away – and has the unique native wildlife and aquamarine bays to match. I recommend a full day exploring here, even an

Cycle over to Little Salmon Bay, meet the adorable quokkas, grab some doughnuts from Rottnest Bakery, go for a dip, take one of the walking trails or turn it up a notch with a tandem skydive. I also had a blast searching for whales aboard the Rottnest Express's Adventure Boat.

        <p class="px-4 sm:px-6 my-6 text-base font-normal text-gray-darkest">
            Your second option for some sought-after island time is a day trip to Penguin Island near Rockingham, 53 kilometres south of Perth. Very different to Rotto, this tiny conservation park hosts around 30 species of seabirds, including (you guessed it) little penguins. The island lies right in the heart of the Shoalwater Islands Marine Park, which boasts more incredible wildlife including sea lions, stingrays and dolphins.

WA’s oldest wine region, wine lovers have long flocked to the Swan Valley in search of a fine drop. Beer connoisseurs also make the pilgrimage, usually heading straight to Mandoon Estate for a taste of the bold German-inspired beer at Homestead Brewery. The buzzy weekend atmosphere is as intoxicating as the ales – stay for a while and soak it all up.

            For years, Perth's food and drink scene was a slow burn. But 2007 welcomed the small bar licence and with it, infectious revelry for the food and beverage industry. With drinking establishments ranging from traditional Aussie pubs and classy wine bars to mammoth craft breweries and restaurants that serve the many moods and flavours of Western Australia, prepare yourself (and your waistline) for indulgence. Here are some of my go-to places for a good feed and even better drinks.

            Yum Cha is a favourite pastime for Perthites, with specialty eateries dotting the city. In Fremantle, Emily Taylor does a Bottomless Yum Cha on weekends that boasts layers upon layers of seafood-bursting dumplings, fluffy bao buns, fried squid, vibrant Asian greens and free-flowing booze. Just be sure to wear your stretchy pants.

            It’s no secret that us locals love a good brunch. Throw in the word ‘bottomless’ and there’s no holding us back. Perth's boozy brunches continue to thrive and they are a fantastic excuse to do some day drinking with mates. Places like Tiisch, The Stables, The Globe, and The Aviary excel at this food and drink phenomenon.

            I also recently frocked up to Santini Grill, located at QT Perth for their High Tea and boy, did it deliver. Paired with tea, coffee or bubbles is a three-tier china plate of divine savouries and pastries. The pancetta tart is rich and buttery – possibly the best I've ever had.
